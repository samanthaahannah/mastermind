For those using Linux, make sure you also install the extra packages quoted on the Linux page above by copying and pasting the command for your OS into the terminal.

### Ruby2D

After you've installed Ruby, and the extra packages if you're using Linux, make sure you're in the root directory and install the gems with `bundle install`. This should install the Ruby2D and Colorize gems.
